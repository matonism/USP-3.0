Participants are more than welcome to bring their own drinks, but we also hope to provide kegs for the event. We decided to have as many kegs as the people want. We've opened the <a target="_blank" href="https://venmo.com/Ultimate-Summer-Party" class="bold-text">Ultimate Summer Party Venmo Account</a> <a target="_blank" href="https://venmo.com/Ultimate-Summer-Party">(@Ultimate-Summer-Party)</a> to fund this venture.  Donate as much as you want to drink and we'll handle the rest.  We will be keeping track of the amount we have raised in terms of kegs. USP2018&trade; brought us 3.
